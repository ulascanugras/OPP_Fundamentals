# What is Abstraction ?
* Abstraction is one of the concepts of Object Oriented Programming.
* Abstraction is used to store details and show only the information requested to be displayed to the user.
* In more succinct terms, it covers the entire field of the use of objects and focuses on areas of interest that we cannot better create and understand.
## Abstract Class
* An instance object cannot be created from abstract classes. To access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class.
## Abstract Method
* It is only used in an abstract class. Nothing is written inside the method. An abstract class can have both abstract methods and normal methods.
